i want to host this react app on google cloud storage. this react app should fetch data from backend that is defined in services FlightServices.js and from cloudsql data must display on browser. give me solution

I'll help you host your React app on Google Cloud Storage and connect it to your backend. Here's a step-by-step solution:
First, let's update the FLIGHT_BASE_API_URL in FlightServices.js to point to your deployed backend URL:
2. Build your React app for production:
npm run build
Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket and configure it for static website hosting:
# Create a new bucket (replace airline-bucket-1 with your desired bucket name)
gsutil mb gs://airline-bucket-1

# Make the bucket public
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://airline-bucket-1

# Enable website configuration
gsutil web set -m index.html -e index.html gs://airline-bucket-1
Update your package.json to include the homepage field pointing to your bucket URL:
Upload your build files to the bucket:
# Navigate to your build directory
cd build

# Upload all files to the bucket
gsutil -m cp -r * gs://airline-bucket-1/
Set CORS configuration for your bucket to allow API requests:
Create a cors.json file:
Apply the CORS configuration:
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://airline-bucket-1
Set up a Load Balancer with HTTPS (recommended):
# Create a backend bucket
gcloud compute backend-buckets create airline-frontend-bucket \
    --gcs-bucket-name=airline-bucket-1

# Create a URL map
gcloud compute url-maps create airline-frontend-lb \
    --default-backend-bucket=airline-frontend-bucket

# Create an HTTPS proxy
gcloud compute target-https-proxies create airline-frontend-proxy \
    --url-map=airline-frontend-lb \
    --ssl-certificates=your-ssl-cert

# Create a forwarding rule
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create airline-frontend-rule \
    --target-https-proxy=airline-frontend-proxy \
    --global \
    --ports=443
Update your backend service (Cloud Run) CORS configuration to allow requests from your frontend domain:
@Configuration
public class CorsConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/**")
            .allowedOrigins("https://storage.googleapis.com")
            .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS")
            .allowedHeaders("*")
            .allowCredentials(true);
    }
}
Make sure your Cloud SQL instance is properly configured:
Enable the Cloud SQL Admin API
Configure your Cloud Run service with the Cloud SQL connection
Set up proper IAM roles and permissions
Here's a sample Cloud Run configuration for connecting to Cloud SQL:
env:
  - name: DB_HOST
    value: "/cloudsql/YOUR_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME"
  - name: DB_NAME
    value: "your_database_name"
  - name: DB_USER
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-credentials
        key: username
  - name: DB_PASS
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-credentials
        key: password
After completing these steps:
Your React app will be hosted at https://storage.googleapis.com/airline-bucket-1
It will communicate with your backend at https://airline-app-image-941806167555.us-central1.run.app
The backend will connect to your Cloud SQL database
Users will be able to perform CRUD operations through the frontend interface
Remember to:
Keep your API keys and sensitive information secure
Set up proper monitoring and logging
Configure appropriate security measures (HTTPS, firewalls, etc.)
Test thoroughly in the production environment
can react fetch data from cloudsql by consuming backend api when first request is send..i dont want to use load balancer or cdn 

Yes, your React app can fetch data from Cloud SQL through your backend API without using a load balancer or CDN. Here's a simpler approach:
1. First, make sure your backend API (running on Cloud Run) is properly connected to Cloud SQL. Your backend is already deployed at https://airline-app-image-941806167555.us-central1.run.app/flight.
Your React app's FlightServices.js is already correctly configured to call this backend:
To deploy your React app to Google Cloud Storage directly:
# Build your React app
npm run build

# Create and configure bucket (if not already done)
gsutil mb gs://airline-bucket-1
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://airline-bucket-1
gsutil web set -m index.html -e index.html gs://airline-bucket-1

# Upload build files
gsutil -m cp -r build/* gs://airline-bucket-1/
Apply the CORS configuration you already have:
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://airline-bucket-1
The data flow will work like this:
User visits your React app at https://storage.googleapis.com/airline-bucket-1
When the ListFlight component mounts, it calls FlightServices.getAllFlights()
This makes an HTTP request to your backend at https://airline-app-image-941806167555.us-central1.run.app/flight
Your backend queries Cloud SQL and returns the data
React displays the data in the browser
To ensure this works:
Add error handling to your ListFlight component:
Make sure your backend's CORS configuration allows requests from the storage.googleapis.com domain:
@CrossOrigin(origins = {
    "https://storage.googleapis.com",
    "http://localhost:3000"  // for local development
})
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/flight")
public class FlightController {
    // ... your endpoints
}
This simpler approach will work well for smaller applications. The React app will be served from Google Cloud Storage and communicate directly with your backend API, which in turn talks to Cloud SQL.
Remember:
Your backend API must be public and accessible
CORS must be properly configured on both frontend and backend
The Cloud SQL instance should be properly secured with appropriate firewall rules
Monitor your API usage and database connections
This setup avoids the complexity of load balancers while still maintaining a secure and functional application architecture.
